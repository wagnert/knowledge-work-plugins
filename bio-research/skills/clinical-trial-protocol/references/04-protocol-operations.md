# Step 4: Clinical Protocol Operations and Statistics

## Purpose

This subskill generates the operational, assessment, and statistical sections (8-11) of a clinical study protocol. It adds efficacy and safety assessments, adverse event reporting, statistical analysis plan with sample size calculation, regulatory/operational considerations, and references to complete the protocol.

## Prerequisites

**Required Files:**
- `waypoints/intervention_metadata.json` (must contain `protocol_template` field from Step 2)
- `waypoints/01_clinical_research_summary.json`
- `waypoints/02_protocol_foundation.md` (sections 1-5 from Step 2)
- `waypoints/03_protocol_intervention.md` (sections 6-7 from Step 3)
- `waypoints/02_protocol_metadata.json` (must show step_3_status: "completed")
- `scripts/sample_size_calculator.py` (for sample size calculation)

## What This Subskill Does

1. Verifies Step 3 completion
2. **Performs sample size calculation** (asks user for parameters, runs calculator script)
3. Reads protocol template (from metadata) and shared guidance
4. Synthesizes operational and statistical content for Sections 8-11
5. Creates new file `waypoints/04_protocol_operations.md` with Sections 8-11
6. **Concatenates all protocol sections** into `waypoints/02_protocol_draft.md`
7. Updates protocol and intervention metadata

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Verify Phase 3 Completion

Read `waypoints/02_protocol_metadata.json` and verify:
- `step_3_status` is "completed"
- `waypoints/02_protocol_foundation.md` exists (Sections 1-5)
- `waypoints/03_protocol_intervention.md` exists (Sections 6-7)

**If Step 3 not completed:**
```
Error: Step 3 must be completed before Phase 4.
Phase 3 status: [current status]

Please complete Step 3 first to generate intervention details (Sections 6-7).
```
Exit.

**If Phase 3 completed:** Proceed to Step 2.

### Step 2: Calculate Sample Size

**BEFORE generating Section 9, perform sample size calculation.**

```

**Paragraph 4: Sensitivity Analyses** (40 lines):
- To assess robustness of sample size, calculations performed under alternative assumptions:

**Alternative Scenario 1: Lower effect size (20% reduction):**
- Effect size: [X * 0.8] [or P2-P1 reduced by 20%]
- Calculated N per arm: [Calculate alternative N]
- Interpretation: [State whether study still adequately powered]

**Alternative Scenario 2: Higher effect size (20% increase):**
- Effect size: [X * 1.2] [or P2-P1 increased by 20%]
- Calculated N per arm: [Calculate alternative N]
- Interpretation: [State increased power]

**Alternative Scenario 3: Higher variance (20% increase in SD):**
- Standard deviation: [Y * 1.2]
- Calculated N per arm: [Calculate alternative N]
- Interpretation: [State impact on power]

**Conclusion:** The proposed sample size is robust to moderate deviations from assumptions. If actual effect size or variance differs substantially from assumptions, study may be underpowered or overpowered.

**Paragraph 5: Power for Secondary Endpoints** (20 lines):
- Sample size is powered for the primary efficacy endpoint only
- Secondary endpoints:
  - Expected to have [greater/similar/lower] effect sizes
  - Study may have [sufficient/insufficient] power to detect clinically meaningful differences in secondary endpoints
  - If power is limited, secondary endpoint analyses may be considered exploratory and hypothesis-generating
- Acknowledge that study is not formally powered for multiple comparisons across all secondary endpoints

**Paragraph 6: Justification and Biostatistician Review** (40 lines):
- Sample size assumptions informed by similar trials:
  - [NCT number and citation 1]
  - [NCT number and citation 2]
  - [NCT number and citation 3]
- Sample size calculation performed using [software, e.g., "nQuery version X", "PASS version X", "R statistical software", "SAS PROC POWER"]
- **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:** "Sample size calculations are preliminary and subject to biostatistician review and validation prior to study initiation. Final sample size may be adjusted based on updated assumptions or regulatory feedback."

- Visual assessment of consistency

**Interpretation:**
- Subgroup analyses are exploratory and hypothesis-generating
- Not adjusted for multiplicity (multiple subgroups tested)
- Interpret with caution: Risk of false positives
- Consistency assessment: Determine if treatment effect is generally consistent across subgroups
- If interaction p < 0.10: Describe difference and note exploratory nature

**Reporting:**

### Step 5: Create Operations File

Create `waypoints/04_protocol_operations.md` with Sections 8-11 only.

**Procedure:**
1. Generate Section 8 content
2. Generate Section 9 content (using sample size calculation results)
3. Generate Section 10 content
4. Generate Section 11 content
5. Write all sections to new file `waypoints/04_protocol_operations.md`
6. Confirm file creation successful

**Note:** The final concatenation of all sections will be performed in Step 5.

### Step 6: Update Protocol Metadata

Update `waypoints/02_protocol_metadata.json`:
- Set `step_4_status` to "completed"
- Add sections 9, 10, 11, 12 to `sections_completed` array
- Update `protocol_status` to "sections_complete" (final concatenation pending)
- Add `waypoint_files` object tracking all protocol section files
- Update notes

**Example:**
```json
{
  "intervention_id": "[from metadata]",
  "intervention_name": "[from metadata]",
  "protocol_version": "1.0 Draft",
  "protocol_date": "[current date]",
  "study_design": "[from Phase 1]",
  "enrollment_target": "[from sample size calculation: adjusted_n_total]",
  "primary_endpoint": "[from Section 4]",
  "duration_months": "[from Phase 1 or generated]",
  "regulatory_pathway": "[IDE or IND]",
  "protocol_status": "sections_complete",

  "step_4_status": "completed",
  "sections_completed": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12],
  "sections_pending": [],
  "sample_size_calculated": true,
  "sample_size_n_per_arm": "[from calculation]",
  "sample_size_n_total": "[from calculation]",
  "notes": [
    "DRAFT for planning purposes",
    "All sections (1-12) generated",
    "Final concatenation pending in Step 5",
    "Sample size calculation completed",
    "Requires biostatistician review",
    "Requires clinical expert review",
    "Requires IRB approval",
    "Requires FDA feedback"
  ]
}
```

### Step 7: Update Intervention Metadata

Update `waypoints/intervention_metadata.json`:
- Add "04-protocol-operations" to `completed_steps` array
- Set `protocol_status` to "sections_complete"

### Step 8: Display Summary

Display concise summary with:
- Intervention name, protocol version, date
- Step 4 completion status
- ALL Sections generated: 1-12
- Operations file created with size

## Output Files

**Created:**
- `waypoints/04_protocol_operations.md` (Sections 8-11)
- `waypoints/02_sample_size_calculation.json` (sample size calculation results)

**Updated:**
- `waypoints/02_protocol_metadata.json` (step 4 marked complete, waypoint_files added)
- `waypoints/intervention_metadata.json` (step 4 marked complete)

**Existing (from prior phases):**
- `waypoints/02_protocol_foundation.md` (Sections 1-6 from Step 2)
- `waypoints/03_protocol_intervention.md` (Sections 7-8 from Step 3)

**To be created in Step 5:**
- `waypoints/protocol_complete.md` (Final concatenated protocol with all 12 sections)

## Error Handling

**If Step 3 not completed:**
```
Error: Step 3 must be completed first.
Current status: step_3_status = [status]

Please complete Step 3 to generate intervention details (Sections 7-8) before proceeding to Phase 4.
```

**If protocol section files missing:**
```
Error: Required protocol section files not found.
Expected:
  - waypoints/02_protocol_foundation.md (Phase 2 output)
  - waypoints/03_protocol_intervention.md (Phase 3 output)

Please ensure Phases 2 and 3 are completed before proceeding to Phase 4.
```

**If sample size calculation fails:**
```
Warning: Sample size calculation could not be performed.
Error: [error message]

Falling back to pattern-based approach using similar trials from Phase 1.
⚠️  IMPORTANT: Sample size requires biostatistician review and validation.

Proceeding with protocol generation using enrollment target from similar trials.
```

```

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing, verify:
- [ ] Sample size calculation completed successfully (or fallback with disclaimer)
- [ ] Section 8 generated with ALL 9 AE/SAE subsections (8.3.1-8.3.9)
- [ ] Section 9 generated with ALL 10 statistical subsections (9.4.1-9.4.10)
- [ ] Sample size section uses actual values from calculation JSON file
- [ ] Section 10 includes all operational subsections
- [ ] Section 11 includes 30-60 references organized by category
- [ ] Content appended successfully to existing protocol draft
- [ ] Protocol metadata updated correctly
- [ ] Intervention metadata updated correctly
- [ ] COMPLETE protocol now contains all 11 sections

## Notes

- **Sample size calculation is interactive** - requires user input
- Output stays within token limits by focusing on Sections 8-11 only
- **This phase generates the final sections** - all 11 sections now generated but not yet concatenated
- User must proceed to Step 5 for final protocol concatenation
